MarTo is using libtool to build programs and libraries.
To run its tests, it uses autotest. And most tests are written
as programs using the GoogleTest framework.

* On Linux, with gcc
** configuring to avoid optimization and adding more debug information

   ../configure CPPFLAGS=-O0 -ggdb3 CXXFLAGS=-O0 --disable-doxygen-doc

** running checks but avoiding some of them
   Example : not rebuilding all programs (ie avoiding tests with the 'clean' keyword)

   make -C build check TESTSUITEFLAGS='-k "!clean"'

** running one GoogleTest under gdb, stopping on first failure

   libtool --mode=execute gdb --args ./build/src/core/test_simple-forward --gtest_break_on_failure
